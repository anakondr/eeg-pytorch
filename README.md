# Motor Imagery EEG data analysis in Pytorch

This repo contains a source code analysis of motor-imagery EEG data in MNE-Python environment, and deep learning model training. 

In particular, on can perform CNN model selection for decoding EEG motor-imagery patterns via PyTorch
This repo was created to help you to get started with EEG + Deep learning research. 

Required packages:
1) pip install mne==0.18.0 
2) conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
3) pip install braindecode
